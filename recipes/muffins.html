        <h3>Blueberry Muffins</h3>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This blueberry muffin recipe makes eight extra large and yummy breakfast muffins with 
            a sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. I usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups 
            just to the top for a wonderful, extra-generously-sized, deli-style muffin. Add extra 
            blueberries if you want!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Muffins</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp Baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>1/3 cup Vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 Large egg</li>
            <li>1/3 cup Milk</li>
            <li>1 cup Fresh blueberries</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Crumb Topping</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup White sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Butter, cubed</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 8 muffin cups or line with paper liners.</li>
            <li>To make the muffins: Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour oil into a small liquid measuring cup. Add egg and enough milk to reach the 1-cup mark; 
                stir until combined.</li>
            <li>Pour into flour mixture and mix just until batter is combined. Fold in blueberries; set batter aside.</li>
            <li>To make the crumb topping: Combine sugar, flour, butter, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Mix with a fork 
                until crumbly.</li>
            <li>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling right to the top. Sprinkle with crumb topping.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 
                20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
