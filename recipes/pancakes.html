        <p>Simply stir everything together and cook the pancakes on a hot griddle or skillet. It doesn’t get any easier 
            than that! This easy pancake recipe is also freezer-friendly, so you can make a double batch and freeze half to

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/3 Cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp baking powder</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 Cup milk</li>
            <li>1 Large egg</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>2 Tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla together until well combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the milk mixture into the flour and fold together just until combined. (It’s okay if there are a few 
                small lumps in the batter. This actually helps make fluffier pancakes!)</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Once hot, rub or brush with butter to lightly grease
                the pan. Working in batches, add ¼ cup of batter for each pancake.</li>
            <li>Cook for a few minutes until golden on the bottom and bubbles start to appear on the top, then flip over and 
                cook an additional minute or until golden brown. Add more butter with each new batch of pancakes. Serve hot 
                with butter and a drizzle of maple syrup.</li>
        </ol>
